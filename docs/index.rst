Welcome to SFINCS's documentation!
======================================

'SFINCS' is the project regarding computationally efficient modelling of compound flooding with the explicit inclusion of wave-driven processes. This site gives a documentation regarding the SFINCS model (Super-Fast INundation of CoastS).
This documentation is however still under construction, mail 'tim.leijnse@deltares.nl' for questions that are not answered yet by this documentation.
Also let us know when you are not yet a user of SFINCS, but would like to get started!

================

SFINCS is initially developed by Maarten van Ormondt at Deltares. A first MSc thesis regarding model evaluation and development is performed by Tim van Engelen (https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Acb904f76-8771-42ab-b069-d645f5c8f7d0?collection=education) and a second one by Tim Leijnse (https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A53037d4d-d7a9-4f71-9b22-8c329f2b384c?collection=education). Also the model is applied in the flood risk assessment of the MSc thesis of Luisa Torres Duenas (https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3d2791c1-902f-4107-a5ed-2bb41d4de592?collection=education).
